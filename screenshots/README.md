Hello,

We encountered some technical difficulties in recording a demonstration. These screenshots serve as a fraction of a presentation,
but unfortunately the API keys have been temporarily disabled. This means we don't have a screenshot of the final result.

However, a full demonstration was provided and recorded by Microsoft Teams during the hackathon. If possible, please refer to this recording for a proper presentation.

We deeply apologize for the inconvience. Please contact me at bentvelj@mcmaster.ca
